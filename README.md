# Flappy Bird with NEAT

## Introduction

One of the biggest roadblocks to training an artificial neural network (ANN)
is determining the proper topology of the network. If the size of the network
is too small, then it cannot solve the problem. On the other hand, if the size
of the network is too large, search for the solution becomes too slow as
the computational power required grows exponentially relative to the size
of the network.
